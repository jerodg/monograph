== Problem
[.lead]
You need to get the human-readable format of file size given the most appropriate unit.

=== Use-Cases
Calculating the most appropriate size notation of an object is a common task in various fields of computer science and data management.
Here are some use cases:

1. **File Management Systems**: In file management systems, it's common to display the size of files and directories in a human-readable format.
This helps users understand the size of their files without having to convert from bytes.

2. **Network Monitoring**: In network monitoring, data transfer rates are often calculated and displayed in a format that's easy to understand.
This could be in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes per second, etc.

3. **Storage Management**: In storage management, the capacity of storage devices (like hard drives, SSDs, memory cards, etc.) is often displayed in a human-readable format.
This helps users understand how much storage they have left.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: In performance monitoring, the amount of memory used by a process or system is often displayed in a human-readable format.
This helps users and administrators understand the memory usage patterns.

5. **Data Processing**: In data processing, the size of datasets is often calculated and displayed in a human-readable format.
This helps users understand the size of the data they are working with.
