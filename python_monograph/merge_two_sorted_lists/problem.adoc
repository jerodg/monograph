== Problem
[.lead]
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one *sorted* list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.


=== Constraints
* The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
* Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in *non-decreasing* order.
