== Problem

[.lead]
The built-in sort doesn't take into account numbers with more than one digit.

[source,lang-py,s-code-block]
----
['Elm11', 'Elm12', 'Elm2', 'elm0', 'elm1', 'elm10', 'elm13', 'elm9']
----

For instance, you are looking for something like this:

[source,lang-py,s-code-block]
----
['elm0', 'elm1', 'Elm2', 'elm9', 'elm10', 'Elm11', 'Elm12', 'elm13']
----

This way elm0 comes before elm10.
