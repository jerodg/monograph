== Problem

[.lead]
You need to find out if two circles intersect, overlap, or encompass eachother.

=== Use-Cases
Checking if two circles intersect, overlap, or encompass each other is a common task in various fields of computer science, mathematics, and physics. Here are some use cases:

1. **Collision Detection**: In computer graphics and game development, this operation is often used for collision detection. If two objects (represented as circles) intersect or overlap, a collision has occurred.

2. **Geospatial Analysis**: In geospatial analysis or Geographic Information System (GIS), this operation can be used to determine if two areas (represented as circles) have any common area, which can be useful in various scenarios like urban planning, route optimization, etc.

3. **Physics Simulations**: In physics simulations, the interaction between two particles or bodies can be determined based on whether they intersect, overlap, or encompass each other.

4. **Computer Vision**: In computer vision, this operation can be used to determine the relative position of circular objects detected in an image.

5. **Robotics**: In robotics, this operation can be used in path planning algorithms where a robot needs to avoid circular obstacles.

These are just a few examples. The concept of checking if two circles intersect, overlap, or encompass can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
