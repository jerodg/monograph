== Problem

[.lead]
You need to find the equilibrium index of an array.
Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes.

Steps to solve the problem:

{empty}1. iterate through i=1 to n:

      *declare a leftsum variable to zero.

      *iterate through 0 till i and add arr[i] to leftsum.

      *declare a rightsum variable to zero.

      *iterate through i+1 till n and add arr[i] to rightsum.

      *check if leftsum is equal to rightsum than return arr[i].

{empty}2. return -1 in case of no point.

=== Use-Cases

Finding the equilibrium index of an array is a common task in various fields of computer science and data analysis.
Here are some use cases:

1. **Balancing Problems**: The equilibrium index can be used to solve balancing problems where you need to divide an array into two halves so that the sum of the elements in both halves is equal.
This can be useful in resource allocation problems where you want to distribute resources evenly.

2. **Data Analysis**: In data analysis, the equilibrium index can be used to find the point of balance in a data set.
This can be useful in understanding the distribution of data.

3. **Algorithm Optimization**: In algorithm design and optimization, finding the equilibrium index can help in reducing the time complexity of certain algorithms.
For example, in divide and conquer algorithms, knowing the equilibrium index can help in dividing the problem into two equal halves.

4. **Game Theory**: In game theory and economics, the concept of equilibrium is widely used.
The equilibrium index can represent a state of a game where no player can gain more by unilaterally changing their strategy.

5. **Signal Processing**: In signal processing, the equilibrium index can be used to find the center of mass of a signal.
This can be useful in applications like image processing, audio processing, etc.

Remember, these are just a few examples.
The concept of equilibrium index can be applied in many other scenarios depending on the problem at hand.
