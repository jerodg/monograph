== Problem
[.lead]
Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to ```target```.


=== Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.
- You can return the answer in any order.
- You may not use the same element twice.


== Examples
=== Example

Input:

 nums = [2,7,11,15]
 target = 9

Output:

 [0,1]

Explanation:

Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

=== Example 1

Input:

 nums = [3,2,4]
 target = 6

Output:

 [1,2]

=== Example 2

Input:

 nums = [3,3]
 target = 6

Output:

 [0,1]


== Follow-up
Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n^2^) time complexity?
