=== Method 0:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_0(ls: list) -> list:
    """Method 0: Set
        Doesn't preserve order

    Args:
        ls: (list)

    Returns:
        result: (list)"""
    return list(set(ls))
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_0`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list.
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a list with the duplicates removed.

The function uses the `set` data structure in Python to achieve this.
A `set` in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
When a list is converted to a `set`, all the duplicate elements are automatically removed.

Here is the main part of the function:

[source,python]
----
return list(set(ls))
----

In this line, `set(ls)` converts the list `ls` to a set, effectively removing all duplicate elements.
The `list()` function then converts this set back to a list.
This is necessary because the function is expected to return a list.

However, it's important to note that sets in Python are unordered.
This means that the order of elements in the original list is not preserved when duplicates are removed.
If the order of elements is important, a different method would need to be used.

This function is a simple and efficient way to remove duplicates from a list when the order of elements is not important.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in data structures and functions can be used to write concise and readable code.

===== Advantages

1. **Simplicity**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in Python data structures and functions, which makes it readable and concise.
2. **Efficiency**: Converting a list to a set is a quick operation in Python.
It's an efficient way to remove duplicates, especially for large lists.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Order is not preserved**: Sets in Python are unordered.
This means that the order of elements in the original list is not preserved when duplicates are removed.
If the order of elements is important, a different method would need to be used.
2. **Not suitable for lists of unhashable items**: The method won't work for lists that contain unhashable items (like lists or dictionaries) because sets only allow hashable items.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of converting a list to a set in Python is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because each element in the list needs to be visited once to add it to the set.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

====== Space

The space complexity of the function is also O(n).
This is because a set data structure is used to store the unique elements from the list.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the set will be equal to the size of the list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_1`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list.
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a list with the duplicates removed.

The function uses the `set` data structure in Python, similar to `method_0`, but with a different syntax.
A `set` in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
When a list is converted to a `set`, all the duplicate elements are automatically removed.

Here is the main part of the function:

[source,python]
----
return [*{*ls}]
----

In this line, `{*ls}` uses the `*` operator for argument unpacking to convert the list `ls` to a set, effectively removing all duplicate elements.
The `[*{*ls}]` then uses the `*` operator again to unpack the set into a list.
This is necessary because the function is expected to return a list.

However, it's important to note that sets in Python are unordered.
This means that the order of elements in the original list is not preserved when duplicates are removed.
If the order of elements is important, a different method would need to be used.

    Args:
        ls: (list)

    Returns:
        result: (list)"""
    unique = set()
    return list([unique.add(n) or n for n in ls if n not in unique])
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_2`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list using a combination of a set and list comprehension.
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a list with the duplicates removed.

The function starts by initializing an empty set named `unique`.
This set will be used to store the unique elements from the list.

[source,python]
----
unique = set()
----

The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements in the list.
For each element `n` in the list, it checks if `n` is not in the `unique` set.
If `n` is not in the `unique` set, it adds `n` to the `unique` set and includes `n` in the new list.
If `n` is already in the `unique` set, it skips `n`.

[source,python]
----
return list([unique.add(n) or n for n in ls if n not in unique])
----

The `unique.add(n) or n` part of the list comprehension is a clever use of the `or` operator.
The `add` method of a set does not return anything (it returns `None`), so `unique.add(n) or n` will always evaluate to `n`.
This allows the function to add `n` to the `unique` set and include `n` in the new list in a single line of code.

However, it's important to note that this method does not preserve the order of the elements in the list.
The order of the elements in the `unique` set is not the same as the order of the elements in the original list.
If the order of elements is important, a different method would need to be used.

This function is a more complex but efficient way to remove duplicates from a list when the order of elements is not important.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in data structures and list comprehensions can be used to write efficient and concise code.

===== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient, especially for large lists.
It uses a set to store unique elements, which allows for fast membership tests.
2. **Readability**: The use of list comprehension makes the code more readable and concise.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Order is not preserved**: This method does not preserve the order of elements in the list.
The order of the elements in the `unique` set is not the same as the order of the elements in the original list.
If the order of elements is important, a different method would need to be used.
2. **Not suitable for lists of unhashable items**: The method won't work for lists that contain unhashable items (like lists or dictionaries) because sets only allow hashable items.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because each element in the list needs to be visited once to add it to the set and check if it's already in the set.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

====== Space

The space complexity of the function is also O(n).
This is because a set data structure is used to store the unique elements from the list.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the set will be equal to the size of the list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

=== Method 3:

==== Implementation

----
def method_3(ls: list) -> list:
    """Using list comprehension
    Method 3:
        Preserves order; keeps first occurance

    return [ii for n, ii in enumerate(ls) if ii not in ls[:n]]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_3`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the duplicates removed.

The function uses list comprehension, a powerful feature in Python that allows for concise and readable code.
The list comprehension iterates over the elements in the list along with their indices.
This is achieved by using the `enumerate` function, which returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over the sequence:

[source,python]
----
for n, ii in enumerate(ls)
----

For each element `ii` in the list, it checks if `ii` is not in the slice of the list that includes all elements before `ii`.
This is done using the slice notation `ls[:n]`, which returns a new list that includes all elements from the start of the list up to, but not including, the element at index `n`:

[source,python]
----
if ii not in ls[:n]
----

If `ii` is not in the slice of the list, it includes `ii` in the new list.
If `ii` is already in the slice of the list, it skips `ii`.
This ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.

This function is a simple and efficient way to remove duplicates from a list when the order of elements is important.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in functions and list comprehensions can be used to write efficient and readable code.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.
It ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
2. **Readability**: The use of list comprehension makes the code more readable and concise.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in functions and list comprehensions can be used to write efficient and readable code.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency**: This method is not as efficient as the methods that use a set to remove duplicates.
It uses the slice notation `ls[:n]` to create a new list that includes all elements before the current element.
This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which makes the overall time complexity of the function O(n^2).
Therefore, this method can be slow for large lists.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list for each element in the list.
This can lead to high memory usage, especially for large lists.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because for each element in the list, it checks if it is in the slice of the list that includes all elements before it.
This operation has a time complexity of O(n), and since it is done for each element in the list, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

====== Space

The space complexity of the function is O(n).
This is because a new list is returned that includes the unique elements from the original list.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.

    unique = []
    for item in ls:
        if item not in unique:

    return unique
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_4`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the duplicates removed.

The function starts by initializing an empty list named `unique`:

[source,python]
----
unique = []
----

Then, it iterates over each `item` in the input list `ls`:

[source,python]
----
for item in ls:
----

For each `item`, it checks if `item` is not already in the `unique` list:

[source,python]
----
if item not in unique:
----

If `item` is not in the `unique` list, it appends `item` to the `unique` list:

[source,python]
----
unique.append(item)
----

This ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the `unique` list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.

Finally, the function returns the `unique` list:

[source,python]
----
return unique
----

This function is a simple and straightforward way to remove duplicates from a list in Python when the order of elements is important.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in list methods and control flow structures can be used to write efficient and readable code.

2. **Readability**: The use of a for-loop and list methods makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in list methods and control flow structures can be used to write efficient and readable code.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency**: This method is not as efficient as the methods that use a set or dictionary to remove duplicates.
It uses the `in` operator to check if an item is in the `unique` list.
This operation has a time complexity of O(n), and since it is done for each element in the list, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n^2).
Therefore, this method can be slow for large lists.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list to store the unique elements.

    return [a for i, a in enumerate(ls) if a not in ls[i + 1 :]]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_5`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
However, unlike some other methods, this function keeps the last occurrence of each element instead of the first.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_5(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it uses list comprehension to create a new list:

[source,python]
----
[a for i, a in enumerate(ls) if a not in ls[i + 1 :]]
----

In this line, `enumerate(ls)` returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over the sequence.
For each element `a` in the list, it checks if `a` is not in the slice of the list that includes all elements after `a`.
If `a` is not in the slice of the list, it includes `a` in the new list.
If `a` is already in the slice of the list, it skips `a`.

This ensures that only the last occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
Finally, the function returns the new list.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Efficiency**: This method is not as efficient as the methods that use a set or dictionary to remove duplicates.
It uses the slice notation `ls[i + 1 :]` to create a new list that includes all elements after the current element.
This operation has a time complexity of O(n), which makes the overall time complexity of the function O(n^2).
Therefore, this method can be slow for large lists.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list for each element in the list.
This can lead to high memory usage, especially for large lists.

=== Method 6:

def method_6(ls: list) -> list:
    """Method 6: dict
        Preserves order; keeps first occurance

    Args:
        ls: (list)

    Returns:
        result: (list)"""
    return list(dict.fromkeys(ls))
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_6`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
It does this by utilizing Python's built-in `dict` and `list` functions.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_6(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it uses the `dict.fromkeys(ls)` function to create a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list `ls`:

[source,python]
----
dict.fromkeys(ls)
----

The `fromkeys()` method returns a new dictionary with the given sequence of elements as the keys of the dictionary.
If the value argument is set, it sets that value for all dictionary elements.
If not provided, the value defaults to None.
In this case, the function is used without a value argument, so it creates a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list `ls` and the values are all None.

The `fromkeys()` method removes duplicates because dictionaries cannot have duplicate keys.
Also, since Python 3.7, dictionaries preserve the order of elements, so the order of elements in the list `ls` is preserved in the dictionary.

Finally, the function converts the dictionary back to a list using the `list()` function and returns the list:

[source,python]
----
return list(dict.fromkeys(ls))
----

The `list()` function creates a list that includes the keys from the dictionary.
Since the dictionary was created using `fromkeys(ls)`, the list includes the elements from the list `ls`, without duplicates and preserving the order of the original elements.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.
It ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
2. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient, especially for large lists.
It uses a dictionary to store unique elements, which allows for fast membership tests.
The time complexity of creating a dictionary from a list is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
3. **Readability**: The use of Python's built-in `dict` and `list` functions makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new dictionary and a new list, which can lead to high memory usage, especially for large lists.
2. **Not suitable for lists of unhashable items**: The method won't work for lists that contain unhashable items (like lists or dictionaries) because dictionaries only allow hashable items.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because the dict.fromkeys(ls) function creates a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list ls, and this operation has a time complexity of O(n).
The list() function then converts the dictionary back to a list, which also has a time complexity of O(n).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

====== Space

The space complexity of the function is O(n).
This is because a new dictionary and a new list are created.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the dictionary and the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

=== Method 7:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_7(ls: list) -> list:
    """Using pandas

    :param ls:
    :type ls:
    :return:
    :rtype:
    """
    return pd.Series(ls).drop_duplicates().tolist()
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_7`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
It does this by utilizing the `pandas` library, which is a powerful data manipulation library in Python.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_7(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it converts the list `ls` into a pandas Series:

[source,python]
----
pd.Series(ls)
----

A pandas Series is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
It is essentially a column in an excel sheet.
The advantage of using a pandas Series over a list is that it provides a lot of powerful methods for data manipulation, including the `drop_duplicates()` method used in this function.

The `drop_duplicates()` method is used to remove duplicate elements from the pandas Series:

[source,python]
----
pd.Series(ls).drop_duplicates()
----

This method returns a new Series with duplicate values removed, preserving the order of the original elements.
It keeps the first occurrence of each element and removes the subsequent duplicates.

Finally, the function converts the pandas Series back to a list using the `tolist()` method and returns the list:

[source,python]
----
return pd.Series(ls).drop_duplicates().tolist()
----

The `tolist()` method returns the Series as a list.
Since the Series was created from the list `ls` and duplicates were removed using `drop_duplicates()`, the returned list includes the elements from the list `ls`, without duplicates and preserving the order of the original elements.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.
It ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
2. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient, especially for large lists.
It uses the `pandas` library, which is optimized for performance and can handle large datasets efficiently.
3. **Readability**: The use of `pandas` makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
It's a good example of how Python's libraries can be used to write efficient and readable code.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Dependency on `pandas`**: This method relies on the `pandas` library.
While `pandas` is a powerful and commonly used library in Python, it might not be available in all environments.
If the `pandas` library is not installed or cannot be used for some reason, this method won't work.
2. **Memory Usage**: `pandas` can be memory-intensive, especially for large datasets.
If memory usage is a concern, other methods might be more suitable.
3. **Overhead**: While `pandas` is efficient for large datasets, it might introduce unnecessary overhead for small lists.
For small lists, other methods like using a set or dictionary might be faster.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is primarily determined by the drop_duplicates() function from the pandas library.
The drop_duplicates() function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because it needs to traverse the entire list once to identify and remove duplicates.
The conversion of the list to a pandas Series and back to a list also takes linear time, but these operations are generally faster and do not significantly affect the overall time complexity.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

====== Space

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because the function creates a new pandas Series from the list and a new list from the Series.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the Series and the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

=== Method 8:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_8(ls: list) -> list:
    """Using numpy

    :param ls:
    :type ls:
    :return:
    :rtype:
    """
    return np.unique(ls).tolist()
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_8`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list.
It does this by utilizing the `numpy` library, which is a powerful library in Python for numerical computations.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_8(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it uses the `numpy.unique()` function to find the unique elements in the list:

[source,python]
----
np.unique(ls)
----

The `numpy.unique()` function returns the sorted unique elements of an array.
It operates on the input array from the leftmost dimension to the rightmost dimension.
The unique elements are returned in sorted order.

Finally, the function converts the numpy array back to a list using the `tolist()` method and returns the list:

[source,python]
----
return np.unique(ls).tolist()
----

The `tolist()` method returns the array as a (nested) list.
Since the array was created from the list `ls` and duplicates were removed using `unique()`, the returned list includes the unique elements from the list `ls`, sorted in ascending order.

===== Advantages

1. **Efficiency**: The `numpy.unique()` function is highly optimized and can be faster than equivalent Python code, especially for large arrays.
2. **Simplicity**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
It uses built-in `numpy` functions, which makes it readable and concise.
3. **Order Preservation**: The `numpy.unique()` function returns the unique elements in sorted order, which can be an advantage if you need the output list to be sorted.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Dependency on `numpy`**: This method relies on the `numpy` library.
While `numpy` is a powerful and commonly used library in Python, it might not be available in all environments.
If the `numpy` library is not installed or cannot be used for some reason, this method won't work.
2. **Memory Usage**: `numpy` can be memory-intensive, especially for large arrays.
If memory usage is a concern, other methods might be more suitable.
3. **Sorting**: The `numpy.unique()` function returns the unique elements in sorted order.
If you need to preserve the original order of elements, this method won't work.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is primarily determined by the numpy.unique() function.
The numpy.unique() function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because it sorts the elements in the list before identifying and removing duplicates.
The conversion of the list to a numpy array and back to a list also takes linear time, but these operations are generally faster and do not significantly affect the overall time complexity.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n log n).

====== Space

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because the function creates a new numpy array from the list and a new list from the array.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the array and the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

=== Method 9:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_9(ls: list) -> list:
    """Using itertools.groupby

    :param ls:
    :type ls:
    :return:
    :rtype:
    """
    return [next(g) for _, g in itertools.groupby(sorted(ls, key=operator.itemgetter(0)))]
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_9`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
It does this by utilizing the `itertools.groupby` function, which is a part of Python's built-in `itertools` module, a collection of tools for handling iterators.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_9(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it sorts the list `ls` and groups it by each element.
The `itertools.groupby` function makes an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable, which in this case is the sorted list `ls`.
The key is a function computing a key value for each element, which is `operator.itemgetter(0)` in this case:

[source,python]
----
itertools.groupby(sorted(ls, key=operator.itemgetter(0)))
----

The `operator.itemgetter(0)` function returns a callable object that fetches item from its operand using the operand’s `__getitem__()` method.
If multiple items are specified, returns a tuple of lookup values.
In this case, it fetches the first item from each group.

Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the groups, and for each group, it uses the `next()` function to get the first element of the group:

[source,python]
----
[next(g) for _, g in itertools.groupby(sorted(ls, key=operator.itemgetter(0)))]
----

The `next()` function retrieves the next item from the iterator.
Since `itertools.groupby` returns groups of consecutive elements in the iterable that have the same key, the first element of each group is a unique element from the list `ls`.
Therefore, the list comprehension returns a list of unique elements from the list `ls`, preserving the order of the original elements.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.
It ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
2. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient, especially for large lists.
It uses the `itertools.groupby` function, which groups consecutive elements that have the same key, reducing the number of comparisons needed to identify duplicates.
3. **Readability**: The use of Python's built-in `itertools` module and list comprehension makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Sorting Requirement**: This method requires the list to be sorted before it can group by each element.
If the original order of elements is important and should be preserved, this method might not be suitable.
2. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new list to store the unique elements, which can lead to high memory usage, especially for large lists.
3. **Dependency on `itertools`**: While `itertools` is a built-in Python module, its usage can make the code more complex and harder to understand for beginners or developers not familiar with it.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is primarily determined by the sorted() function and the itertools.groupby() function.
The sorted() function has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because it sorts the elements in the list before grouping them.
The itertools.groupby() function, on the other hand, has a time complexity of O(n), as it groups the sorted elements.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n log n).

====== Space

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because the function creates a new list from the groups generated by the itertools.groupby() function.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).

==== Tests

=== Method 10:

==== Implementation

[source,python,linenums]
----
def method_10(ls: list) -> list:
    """Using OrderedDict

    :param ls:
    :type ls:
    :return:
    :rtype:
    """
    return list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(ls))
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_10`.
This function is designed to remove duplicate elements from a list while preserving the order of the original elements.
It does this by utilizing the `OrderedDict` class from Python's built-in `collections` module.

The function starts by taking a list `ls` as an argument:

[source,python]
----
def method_10(ls: list) -> list:
----

Then, it uses the `fromkeys()` method of the `OrderedDict` class to create a new ordered dictionary from the list `ls`.
The `fromkeys()` method is a class method that returns a new dictionary.
The elements of the list `ls` are used as the keys of the dictionary, and the values are set to `None`:

[source,python]
----
OrderedDict.fromkeys(ls)
----

The `OrderedDict` class is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which its contents are added.
This means that when you iterate over the keys or values of an `OrderedDict`, they will be returned in the order they were added.
Since the `fromkeys()` method adds the keys in the order they appear in the list `ls`, the resulting `OrderedDict` preserves the order of the original elements.

Finally, the function converts the `OrderedDict` back to a list:

[source,python]
----
return list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(ls))
----

The `list()` function is a built-in Python function that creates a list from an iterable.
In this case, it creates a list from the keys of the `OrderedDict`, which are the unique elements from the list `ls` in their original order.
Therefore, the function returns a list of unique elements from the list `ls`, preserving the order of the original elements.

===== Advantages

1. **Preserves Order**: This method preserves the order of elements in the list.
It ensures that only the first occurrence of each element is included in the new list, effectively removing duplicates while preserving the order of the original elements.
2. **Efficiency**: This method is efficient, especially for large lists.
It uses the `OrderedDict` class, which is implemented as a doubly-linked list.
This allows it to maintain the insertion order of the keys, making it faster than regular dictionaries for certain operations.
3. **Readability**: The use of Python's built-in `OrderedDict` class makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
It's a good example of how Python's built-in classes can be used to write efficient and readable code.

===== Disadvantages

1. **Memory Usage**: This method creates a new `OrderedDict` and a new list, which can lead to high memory usage, especially for large lists.
If memory usage is a concern, other methods might be more suitable.
2. **Dependency on `collections`**: While `collections` is a built-in Python module, its usage can make the code more complex and harder to understand for beginners or developers not familiar with it.
3. **Overhead**: The `OrderedDict` class has more overhead than regular dictionaries due to the additional linked list that is used to maintain the order of the keys.
This can make it slower than regular dictionaries for certain operations.

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this method is primarily determined by the OrderedDict.fromkeys(ls) operation.
This operation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because it needs to traverse the entire list once to create the OrderedDict.
Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n).

====== Space

The space complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
This is because the function creates a new OrderedDict and a new list.
In the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), the size of the OrderedDict and the new list will be equal to the size of the original list.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the list, which is O(n).
