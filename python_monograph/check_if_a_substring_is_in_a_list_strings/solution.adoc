    return any(substr in x for x in data)
----

==== Explanation

The selected Python code defines a function named `method_0` that checks if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list.

[source,python]
----
def method_0(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
----

The function takes two parameters: `data`, which is a list of strings, and `substr`, which is the substring to be searched for.
The function returns a boolean value, `True` if the substring is found in any of the strings in the list, and `False` otherwise.

The core of the function is a single line of code that uses the built-in Python function `any()`.

[source,python]
----
return any(substr in x for x in data)
----

The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one element of the iterable it is given is `True`, and `False` otherwise.
In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that checks if `substr` is in each string `x` in the list `data`.

The `in` keyword in Python is used to check if a value is present in a sequence (like a list or a string).
In this context, it checks if the substring `substr` is found within the string `x`.

So, the expression `substr in x for x in data` generates a sequence of boolean values, one for each string in `data`, indicating whether `substr` is found in that string.
The `any()` function then checks this sequence and returns `True` if `substr` is found in any string, and `False` if it is not found in any string.

In summary, `method_0` is a function that checks if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list, returning a boolean value to indicate the result.

===== Advantages

===== Disadvantages

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this function is O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings.
This is because for each string, we are checking if the substring exists in it, which takes O(m) time.
====== Space The space complexity of this function is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.
The generator expression does not create a new list but generates each value on the fly, so it does not use additional space proportional to the size of the input list.

    for row in data:
        if row.find(substr) != -1:  # Returns -1 if not found
            return True
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_1`.
This function is designed to check if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two arguments: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings, and `substr` is the substring to be searched for.

The function uses the `find()` method in a for-loop to search for the substring.
The `find()` method is a built-in Python method for strings that returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the given string.
If it's not found, `find()` returns -1.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
for row in data:
    if row.find(substr) != -1:  # Returns -1 if not found
        return True
----

In this code, `row` represents each string in the `data` list.
The `find(substr)` method is called on `row` to search for the `substr`.
If `find()` does not return -1, it means that the substring is found in `row`, and the function immediately returns `True`.

If the function goes through all the strings in the list without finding the substring (i.e., `find()` returns -1 for all strings), the function will end without returning anything.
In Python, if a function ends without hitting a return statement, it automatically returns `None`.
Therefore, in this case, the function effectively returns `None` when the substring is not found in any of the strings in the list.

This function is a straightforward and efficient way to check if a substring exists in any string in a list.
It stops searching as soon as it finds the substring, which can save time when dealing with large lists.

            boolean (bool)

    return True if [x for x in data if x.find(substr) != -1] else False
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_2`.
This function is designed to check if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two arguments: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings, and `substr` is the substring to be searched for.

The function uses the `find()` method in combination with a list comprehension to search for the substring.
The `find()` method is a built-in Python method for strings that returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the given string.
If it's not found, `find()` returns -1.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
[x for x in data if x.find(substr) != -1]
----

In this code, `x` represents each string in the `data` list.
The `find(substr)` method is called on `x` to search for the `substr`.
If `find()` does not return -1, it means that the substring is found in `x`, and `x` is included in the new list created by the list comprehension.

The function then checks if this new list is not empty.
If the list is not empty, it means that the substring was found in at least one string in the list, and the function returns `True`.
If the list is empty, it means that the substring was not found in any string in the list, and the function returns `False`.

This function is a compact and efficient way to check if a substring exists in any string in a list.
It leverages the power of list comprehensions in Python to perform the check in a single line of code.

===== Advantages

===== Disadvantages

===== Complexity Analysis

====== Time

The time complexity of this function is O(nm), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings.
This is because the join() method concatenates all the strings into one, which takes O(nm) time, and then we are checking if the substring exists in this concatenated string, which also takes O(n*m) time in the worst case.
====== Space The space complexity of this function is O(nm), as we are creating a new string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list.
This new string can potentially have a length equal to the total length of all the strings in the list, which is nm.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the size of this new string, which is O(n*m).

            https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=join#str.join"""
    return substr in "\t".join(data)
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_3`.
This function is designed to check if a substring is present in a concatenated string of all the strings in a list.
The function takes two arguments: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings, and `substr` is the substring to be searched for.

The function uses the `join()` method to concatenate all the strings in the list into one string.
The `join()` method is a built-in Python method for strings that concatenates a list of strings into one string, with a specified string as the separator.
In this case, the separator is a tab character (`"\t"`).

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
"\t".join(data)
----

In this code, `data` is the list of strings, and `"\t"` is the separator.
The `join()` method concatenates all the strings in `data` into one string, with a tab character between each pair of strings.

After concatenating the strings, the function checks if the substring `substr` is present in this concatenated string.
This is done using the `in` keyword in Python, which checks if a substring is present in a string.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this check:

[source,python]
----
substr in "\t".join(data)
----

In this code, `substr in "\t".join(data)` returns `True` if `substr` is found in the concatenated string, and `False` otherwise.

This function is a simple and efficient way to check if a substring exists in any string in a list.
It leverages the power of Python's string methods to perform the check in a single line of code.

    for row in data:
        if substr in row:
            return True
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_4`.
This function is designed to check if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two arguments: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings, and `substr` is the substring to be searched for.

The function uses a for-loop to iterate over each string in the `data` list.
For each string, it checks if the substring `substr` is present in the string.
This is done using the `in` keyword in Python, which checks if a substring is present in a string.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
for row in data:
    if substr in row:
        return True
----

In this code, `row` represents each string in the `data` list.
The `if substr in row` statement checks if `substr` is present in `row`.
If `substr` is found in `row`, the function immediately returns `True`.

If the function iterates over all the strings in the list without finding the substring, it will finish without returning anything.
In Python, if a function finishes without hitting a return statement, it returns `None` by default.
Therefore, if the substring is not found in any string in the list, the function will return `None`.

This function is a straightforward and efficient way to check if a substring exists in any string in a list.
It leverages the power of Python's `in` keyword to perform the check in a simple and readable way.

====== Space The space complexity of this function is O(n), as we are creating a new list that contains all the strings in which the substring is found.
In the worst case, the substring could be in all the strings, so the new list would have the same length as the input list, which is n.
Therefore, the space complexity is proportional to the size of this new list, which is O(n).

    return True if [x for x in data if substr in x] else False
----

==== Explanation

The selected code is a Python function named `method_5`.
This function is designed to check if a substring is present in any of the strings in a list.
The function takes two arguments: `data` and `substr`. `data` is a list of strings, and `substr` is the substring to be searched for.

The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that contains all the strings in `data` where the substring `substr` is found.
List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists based on existing lists in Python.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this operation:

[source,python]
----
[x for x in data if substr in x]
----

In this code, `x for x in data if substr in x` generates a new list that contains all the strings in `data` where `substr` is found.
The `if substr in x` part is a condition that filters the list comprehension, so only strings where `substr` is found are included in the new list.

After creating the new list, the function checks if the list is empty.
If the list is not empty, it means that the substring was found in at least one string in `data`, so the function returns `True`.
If the list is empty, it means that the substring was not found in any string in `data`, so the function returns `False`.

Here's a snippet of the code that performs this check:

[source,python]
----
return True if [x for x in data if substr in x] else False
----

In this code, `True if [x for x in data if substr in x] else False` returns `True` if the list comprehension is not empty, and `False` otherwise.

This function is a concise and efficient way to check if a substring exists in any string in a list.
It leverages the power of Python's list comprehensions to perform the check in a single line of code.
