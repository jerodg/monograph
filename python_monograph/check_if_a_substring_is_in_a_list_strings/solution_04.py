def method_4(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
    """This function checks if a given substring is found in any of the strings in a list using a for-loop.

    The function iterates over each string in the list using a for-loop.
    For each string, it checks if the substring is found in the string using the 'in' operator.
    If the substring is found in any string, the function immediately returns True.
    If the substring is not found in any string after iterating over the entire list, the function returns False.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in any string in the list, False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> method_4(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], "app")
        True
    >>> method_4(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], "z")
        False
