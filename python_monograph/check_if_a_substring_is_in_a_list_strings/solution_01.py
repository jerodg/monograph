def solution_01(data: List[str], substr: str) -> bool:
    """This function checks if a given substring is found in any of the strings in a list using the find() method.

    The find() method returns the lowest (first) index in the string where the substring is found within the slice.
    If the substring is not found, the find() method returns -1.

    Parameters:
        data (List[str]): A list of strings where the substring will be searched.
        substr (str): The substring to search in the list of strings.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the substring is found in any string in the list, False otherwise.

    Note:
        This function does not provide the location of the substring in the string.

    Example:
    >>> solution_01(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], "app")
    True
    >>> solution_01(["apple", "banana", "cherry"], "z")
    False
