== Python provides a Boolean data type. Objects of Boolean type may have one of two values, _____ or _____.
- True, False

== In Python 3, the maximum value for an integer is 2^63^ - 1:
- False

NOTE: In Python 3, there is no explicit limit to the size of an integer value. The amount of available address space (hardware)
forms a practical limit depending on the machine Python runs on.

== How would you express the hexadecimal value `+a5+` as a base-16 integer constant in Python?

- 0xa5

== How would you express the constant floating-point value 3.2 × 10^-12^ in Python:
- 3.2e-12

NOTE: We’re looking for a _constant_ value, so an _expression_ like `+3.2 * 10 ** -12+` would *not* be a valid answer in this case.

== Which of the following are valid ways to specify the string literal `+foo'bar+` in Python:

a) `+"foo'bar"+` +
b) `+'foo\'bar'+` +
c) `+'foo'bar'+` +
d) `+"""foo'bar"""+` +
e) `+'foo''bar'+` +

- a, b, d

== Write an expression for a string literal consisting of the following ASCII characters:

* Horizontal Tab character
* Newline (ASCII Linefeed) character
* The character with hexadecimal value `+7E+`

- `+'\t\n\x7E'+`

== Consider this statement:

[source,python]
----
print(r'foo\\bar\nbaz')
----

Which of the following is the correct REPL output?

a) `+foo\\bar\nbaz+` +
b) `+foo\bar\nbaz+` +
c) `+foo\\barnbaz+` +
d) `+foo\bar+` +
e) `+baz+` +

- `foo\\bar\nbaz`


== Which of the following is not a Python built-in function: +
a) `+map()+` +
b) `+isinstance()+` +
c) `+round()+` +
d) `+repr()+` +
e) `+diff()+` +

- `diff()`
